Following is a list of features created for EveryBlock.com since EveryBlock source code was released on June 30, 2009. These are the elements that would have to be added to the OpenBlock code to get to where EveryBlock was on the day it was removed from the Internet (http://blog.everyblock.com/2013/feb/07/goodbye/)

This is a repository for OpenBlock code with a set of issues associated with it. The issues all describe features created for EveryBlock.com since EveryBlock source code was released on June 30, 2009 (http://blog.everyblock.com/2009/jun/30/source/).

Issues labeled "bug" are the features that would have to be added to the OpenBlock code to get to where EveryBlock was on the day it was removed from the Internet (http://blog.everyblock.com/2013/feb/07/goodbye/).

Issues labeled "enhacement" are the features that I think would be good to have in a relaunched openblock-style site. 

Most issues are pretty straightforward. The exception is the redesign around neighbor messages-- this was a lot of work with many nuances.

Info about OpenBlock
====================

OpenBlock is a web application and RESTful service that allows users
to browse and search their local area for "hyper-local news" - to see
what's going on recently in the immediate geographic area.

For installation instructions and other documentation, see
http://openblockproject.org/docs/ (or the .rst files in the docs/ directory).

For help, you can try the ebcode group:
http://groups.google.com/group/ebcode
or look for us in the #openblock IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.

OpenBlock began life as the open-source code released by
Everyblock.com in June 2009.  Originally created by Adrian Holovaty
and the Everyblock team, it is now developed as an open-source (GPL)
project by OpenPlans, at http://openblockproject.org.

Funding for the initial creation of Everyblock and the ongoing
development of OpenBlock has been provided by the Knight Foundation
(http://www.knightfoundation.org/).

About this project
==================

This is merely a set of code and issues as a way to capture some thinking about
what a block-level or address-level information service might look like. There
are lots of projects in Chicago that tangentially relate to this concept. I 
welcome input!
